# Trivia Quiz

## Description
I was assigned to create a dynamic multiple choice quiz using primarily JavaScript. I attempted this to challenge myself and my knowledge of JS while also creating a fun little game quiz. I quickly learned that I need to continue working on my JS syntax.

## Troubleshooting
I had the start button and timer working, I also was able to append the answer buttons to the html via JS. Once both were set up, everything broke. Unfortunately, I was able to figure why that happened. I had ideas about how to implement questions and choices using an array of obects and somehow configure it to switch using some kind of For Loop function. I was created some code for utilizing the local storage to save high scores, however I didnt get far because I was trying to troubleshoot the buttons.
